3.2 SAMPLE INSTALLATION

The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate usage.


Scenario:

 - The application is to be installed in $HOME/opt/misc of an unprivileged user.
 - The filesystem path to your Mint main log is:
     /opt/ands/mint-builds/current/home/logs/main.log
 - You want to monitor unmatched NLA IDs listed during the 8:00am Mint
   housekeeping job. That is, target_time is 8:00am. Hence, you can only expect
   valid results if the nla_unmatched.sh script is run *after* this time each day.
 - You want NLA ID unmatched notification emails to be sent to:
   * me@example.com, and
   * you@example.com
 - Your Mint person records can be access via URL
   https://MY_SERVER.example.com/mint/default/detail/OBJECT_ID/, that is:
   * prefix of OBJECT_ID is 'https://MY_SERVER.example.com/mint/default/detail/'
   * suffix of OBJECT_ID is '/'

Instructions:

mkdir ~/opt
git clone https://github.com/grantj-re3/FlindersRedbox-misc.git ~/opt/misc
cd ~/opt/misc

# If you want a particular version

# Read files INSTALL* LICENSE README*

# Edit bin/nla_unmatched.sh for your environment if applicable.

# Run the script
bin/nla_unmatched.sh

# Check results in your email inbox.

# If successful, install the script into your crontab and test again.
# Note that for the default target_time of 8:00am, the cron job must
# be scheduled to run after 8:00am.

# Celebrate!
