1. APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT

This script has been tested in the following environment:
- GNU bash, version 4.1.2(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.3 (Santiago)
- 2.6.32-279.11.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Sat Sep 22 07:10:26 EDT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- https://github.com/redbox-mint/redbox-build-dev-local/tree/redbox-local-curation-demo-1.6.1
- https://github.com/redbox-mint/mint-build-dev-local/tree/mint-local-curation-demo-1.6.1

It is expected that the script will also operate with little or no modification
under other versions of bash and perhaps sh and ksh.

This software has not been designed to run under the Microsoft Windows
operating system, but it may be feasible under Cygwin (see http://www.cygwin.com).
